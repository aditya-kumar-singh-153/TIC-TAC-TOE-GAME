# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
 A web-based Tic-tac-toe game utilizes HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Players click grid cells to place X or O marks, triggering logic to determine wins or draws. This project exemplifies the synergy of these technologies, creating an engaging user experience in a web browser.
